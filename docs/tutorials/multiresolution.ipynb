Since the HST image is at a much higher resolution, we define our model `Frame` to use the HST PSF and the HST resolution. Because there is no resampling between the model frame and the HST observation, we can use the default `Observation` class for the HST data. The HSC images have lower resolution, so we need to resample the models to this frame, and that's done by `LowResObservation`.\n",
