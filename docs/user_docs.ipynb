    "## Basic Concepts and Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of *scarlet* is to create a model of individual astrophysical sources from a collection of observations of a blended region of the sky. These observations can be in multiple filter bands (which we will call \"channels\" internally), telescopes with different resolutions, and eventually even spectroscopic instruments. As is pointed out by Robert Lupton, perfect reconstruction of a blended scene is [impossible](https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-29071), however by making a few minor assumptions *scarlet* improves on other blending algorithms by leveraging as much data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumption of *scarlet* is that the sources in an astrophysical image can be thought of as a collection of multiple [Component](component.ipynb#scarlet.component.Component) objects, where each component has a single morphology (shape) that is the same in each band (SED). In this model more complicated objects, like galaxies, can be thought of as a combination multiple components (a [ComponentTree](component.ipynb#scarlet.component.ComponentTree)), where components with different SEDs represent different populations of stars or gases in the host galaxy. In order to properly separate sources further assumptions are required, for example assuming that all of the flux is positive and that stars and galaxies monotonically decrease from their centers. The use of constraints is discussed in more detail in [Updates and Constraints](#Updates-and-Constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "A [Frame](observation.ipynb#scarlet.observation.Frame) contains the metadata for the hyperspectral cube *scarlet* seeks to construct by fitting one [Observation](observation.ipynb#scarlet.observation.Observation) or several observations. Each observation can have multiple filter bands with a different PSF in each band that is internally matched to the target PSF of the model. This allows the model to be convolved into each observed frame for comparison with the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the [Blend](blend.ipynb#scarlet.blend.Blend) class contains the `frame`, `observations`, and `sources` (a list of [Component](component.ipynb#scarlet.component.Component) or [ComponentTree](component.ipynb#scarlet.component.ComponentTree) objects) and executes the optimization algorithm. [Blend](blend.ipynb#scarlet.blend.Blend) also implements the minimization algorithm described in [Melchior et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10157), which is briefly described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deblending algorithm forms a model of the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{M}= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathsf{A}_k^T \\times \\mathsf{S}_k = \\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{A}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^B$ is the normalized SED and $\\mathsf{S}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is the morphology of a single component in the model with $B$ bands and $N$ pixels in each band.\n",
    "It is important to note that this matrix factorization implies that SEDs and morphologies are independent, e.g. the SED of a component does not change over the region covered by its morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scene is fit by minimizing the likelihood of the model, namely minimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{S}) = \\frac{1}{2} || \\mathsf{Y}-\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S} ||_2^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{Y}$ is an image cube and $||.||_2$ is the element-wise $L_2$ (Frobenius) norm.\n",
    "Each component $k$ can have $M_k$ different constraint functions $g_{km}$, equivalent to minimizing\n",
    "$$f(\\mathsf{A}, \\mathsf{S}) + \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{m=1}^{M_k} g^A_{km} \\left(\\mathsf{A}_{km} \\right) + g^S_{km} \\left(\\mathsf{S}_{km} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Those constraints are applied to each source in the form of proximal operators, a handy mathematical approach for imposing non-smooth constraints that (if properly formulated) are guaranteed to converge; the curious reader will find more details in [Parikh & Boyd 2014](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/prox_algs.pdf) and [Combettes & Pesquet 2011](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-9569-8_10).\n",
    "In short, proximal operators map an input vector to the nearest vector that satisfied the respective constraint.\n",
    "Many constraints/penalty functions have analytic proximal operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the PSF of the model $\\mathsf{M}$ above is the target PSF of the [Scene](observation.ipynb#scarlet.observation.Scene), meaning the likelihood we evaluate is more complicated than the one shown above due to an extra PSF convolution performed in each band with the difference kernel to match the seeing in each [Observation](observation.ipynb#scarlet.observation.Observation) filter band. *scarlet* uses the [autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) package to calculate the gradient of this more complicated model in each iteration during optimization."

As mentioned in the [Introduction](#Basic-Concepts-and-Structure), constraints are applied as proximal operators which can simplistically be thought of as projections of a model parameter to the space where the constraint is met.

    "Passing `type=\"sed\"` to [normalized](update.ipynb#normalized) normalizes the `sed` so that its elements sum to unity, making `sed` a normalized SED while `morph` contains all of of the shape and intensity information. This has the advantage that the SED, which converges much faster when it is normalized, is stable for the majority of the iterations. The disadvantage is that overlapping sources that are roughly the same color but have very different intensities (which is common in galaxy clusters, for example) can be difficult to separate with this normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `type=\"morph\"` normalizes the `morph` matrix so that it sums to unity for each source, so that `sed` now contains both color and intensity information. The advantage to this method is that two sources with very similar colors are easier to distinguish if they have very different intensities. The other big advantage of this normalization is that true point sources can be fit much more easily and efficiently by fixing the morphology and normalizing `morph`, meaning the intensity of the central pixel equals 1 for all iterations and only the colors and intensities in `sed` are modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of this method is that using `type=\"morph\"` for an [ExtendedSource](#scarlet.source.ExtendedSource) causes fluctuations in the values of the outer pixels during fitting to affect the overall global normalization of `morph` for each source, meaning a peak pixel that is relatively well constrained will not be fixed if a large number of pixels on the outer edges of the source change value (which can happen while fitting regions with low signal to noise, especially if they overlap with another source).\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit this affect we provide the `type=\"morph_max\"` normalization, which normalizes `morph` so that the peak is always set to a value of 1. This should make the values near the peak more robust and usually results in faster convergence and lower residuals compared to the other two normalization schemes. For this reason it is the default normalization in *scarlet*.\n",

If this constraint feels overly restrictive, recall that virtually all galaxy model fitting impose symmety using more restrictive Sersic profiles, which also make assumptions about the radial profile.\n",

    "In order to model individual sources in an image it is usually necessary to give each source a center position (for jets and irregular galaxies the concept of \"center\" is a bit less defined). Traditional photometric measurements typicaly define the center by the weighted center of flux calculation (commonly abusing terminology and refering to the position as a *centroid*, not to be confused with the *geometric centroid*). This location can be misleading because in a blend the center of flux for blended objects will naturally be shifted toward any neighboring sources, so naively using the center of flux for a source in the observations will be insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the location of the peak pixel is sufficient (e.g. [monotonicity](#Monotonicity)) without worrying about the subpixel location. In these cases the [fit_pixel_center](update.ipynb#scarlet.update.fit_pixel_center) method can be used to find the pixel in `component.morph` with the maximum flux and use that to set `component.pixel_center`. It is possible to pass a `window` to [fit_pixel_center](update.ipynb#scarlet.update.fit_pixel_center), where `(0, 0)` is the center of the morphology, and only use the flux inside that window to determine the pixel center. By default `window = (slice(cy-2, cy+3), slice(cx-2, cx+3))`, meaning only pixels in a $7\\times 7$ window centered on the estimated center position are used to search for the peak pixel. This prevents bright sources on the outskirts of fainter ones from causing the pixel center to jump from the fainter source to a pixel in the brighter source.\n",

    "When a more precise center is needed the center of flux of the *morphology* can be used to estimate the center of the source.
