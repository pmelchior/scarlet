    "The [API Documentation](api_docs.rst) contains more detailed descriptions of the modules and classes used in *scarlet*, and a more rigorous overview of the mathematics and algorithms used by *scarlet* is described in [Moolekamp & Melchior 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09066) and [Melchior et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10157).\n",

    "\n",
    "*scarlet* is designed to separate sources in astrophysical images by assuming that each scene can be thought of as a collection of multiple [Component](component.ipynb#scarlet.component.Component) objects.\n",
    "Each component has a center, morphology (shape) and spectrum (or SED) with a set of [Constraint](constraint.ipynb#scarlet.constraint.Constraint)s they need to obey.\n",
    "Components can be grouped into [Source](source.ipynb#scarlet.source.Source), e.g. for bulge-disk models, that can enforce additional constraints on the centers, SEDs, and morphologies of all components. It's a base class, from which specialized classes can be derived to adjust to the sitation at hand. \n",
    "This customization can comprise the number of components, their initialization, and the constraints they need to obey, or all of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Blend](blend.ipynb#scarlet.blend.Blend) class contains all of the information about the scene, i.e. the collection of components, as well as routines for fitting the joint model to data.\n",
    "It implements the minimization algorithm described in [Moolekamp & Melchior 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09066).\n",
    "Below is a very brief summary of the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The deblending algorithm forms a model of the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{M}= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathsf{A}_k^T \\times \\mathsf{S}_k = \\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{A}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^B$ is the normalized SED and $\\mathsf{S}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is the morphology of a single component in the model with $B$ bands and $N$ pixels in each band.\n",
    "It is important to note that this matrix factorization implies that SEDs and morphologies are independent, e.g. the SED of a component does not change over the region covered by its morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scene is fit by minimizing the likelihood of the model, namely minimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{S}) = \\frac{1}{2} || \\mathsf{Y}-\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S} ||_2^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{Y}$ is an image cube and $||.||_2$ is the element-wise $L_2$ (Frobenius) norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component $j$ can have $M_j$ different constraint functions $g_{ji}$, equivalent to minimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathsf{A}, \\mathsf{S}) + \\sum_{j=1}^K \\sum_{i=1}^{M_j} g^A_{ji} \\left(\\mathsf{A}_{ji} \\right) + g^S_{ji} \\left(\\mathsf{S}_{ji} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Those constraints are applied to each source in the form of proximal operators, a handy mathematical approach for imposing non-smooth constraints that (if properly formulated) are guaranteed to converge; the curious reader will find more details in [Parikh & Boyd 2014](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/prox_algs.pdf) and [Combettes & Pesquet 2011](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-9569-8_10).\n",
    "In short, proximal operators map an input vector to the nearest vector that satisfied the respective constraint.\n",
    "Many constraints/penalty functions have analytic proximal operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "*scarlet* allows for two different kinds of constraints: proximal operators in the direct domain (that is directly on the SEDs $\\mathsf{A}_k$ and morphologies $\\mathsf{S}_k$) or in the transformed domain, i.e. after SEDs and morphologies are transformed by a linear operator $\\mathsf{L}$ that is specified by the user. Any linear operator is allowed (it does not have to be invertible), examples are finite differences or basis transforms. The main reason for working in the transformed domain is that it can be much easier to express the constraint, for instance that a particular solution have only one Fourier coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proximal operators for the direct and transformed domain behave differently. The former can be thought of as *strictly* obeyed at every iteration, while the latter ones will converge to a solution that obeys the constraint eventually. \n",
    "To see this it is useful to understand how $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{S}$ are updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow \\textrm{prox}_{\\lambda f} \\left( x^{\\textrm{it}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho} \\mathsf{L}^T \\left( \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}}-z^{\\textrm{it}} + u^{\\textrm{it}} \\right) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow \\textrm{prox}_{\\rho g} \\left( \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}+1} + u^{\\textrm{it}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow u^{\\textrm{it}} + \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}+1} - z^{\\textrm{it}+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x^{\\textrm{it}}$ denotes either $\\mathsf{A}_k$ or $\\mathsf{S}_k$ in the current iteration, and $\\textrm{prox}_f$ performs (at least) a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the log-likelihood. $\\textrm{prox}_g$ is the proximal operator in the transformed domain as it acts on $\\mathsf{L} x$ instead of $x$.\n",
    "If additional constraints in the direct domain are present, they will be subsumed in $\\textrm{prox}_f$, thus making sure that they are satisfied in every iteration."

    "The product of two matrices, in this case $AS$, has infinite solutions if both $A$ and $S$ are allowed to vary. Typically this degeneracy is broken by normalizing either the $A$ or $S$ matrix in some way. In _scarlet_ this normalization is left up to the user by setting the `normalization` parameter of a source to a [Normalization](constraint.ipynb#scarlet.constraint.Normalization) member. \n",

    "\n",
    "`Normalization.A` normalizes the $A$ matrix so that it sums to unity for each source, essentially making $A$ a  normalized SED while the $S$ matrix contains both shape and intensity information. This has the advantage that the SED, which converges much faster, is stable for the majority of the iterations. The disadvantage is that overlapping sources that are roughly the same color but have very different intensities (which is common in galaxy clusters, for example) can be difficult to separate with this normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Normalization.S` normalizes the $S$ matrix so that it sums to unity for each source, so that $A$ now contains both color and intensity information. The advantage to this method is that two sources with very similar colors are easier to distinguish if they have very different intensities. The other big advantage of this normalization is that true point sources can be fit much more easily and efficiently by fixing the morphology and normalizing $S$, meaning the intensity of the central pixel equals 1 for all iterations and only the colors and intensities in $A$ are modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of this method is that using `Normalization.S` for an [ExtendedSource](#scarlet.source.ExtendedSource) causes fluctuations in the values of the outer pixels during fitting to affect the overall global normalization of $S$ for each source, meaning a peak pixel that is relatively well constrained will not be fixed if a large number of pixels on the outer edges of the star change value (which can happen while fitting regions with low signal to noise, especially if they overlap with another source).\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit this affect there is also a `Normalization.Smax` normalization, which normalizes $S$ so that the peak is always set to a value of 1. In theory this should make the values near the peak more robust because it fixes the scale of the morphology, but in practice using `Normalization.S` appears to be the fastest algorithm to converge, with better residuals than the other two normalization methods. However, until this is fully tested and demonstrated on a larger sample of real and simulated images, the default normalization is `Normalization.A` to keep backwards compatibility with older versions of _scarlet_ and $S$ normalization should be thought of as preliminary. Check back later for more updates.\n",
