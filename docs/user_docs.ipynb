    "\n",
    "*scarlet* is designed to separate sources in astrophysical images by assuming that each scene can be thought of as a collection of multiple [Source](source.ipynb#scarlet.source.Source) objects.\n",
    "Each [Source](source.ipynb#scarlet.source.Source) can be made up of multiple components, where each component has a single morphology (shape) and uniform spectrum (or SED) with a set of [Constraints](constraints.ipynb#scarlet.constraints.Constraint) they need to obey.\n",
    "The [Source](source.ipynb#scarlet.source.Source) class is a base class, from which specialized classes can be derived to adjust to the sitation at hand. \n",
    "This customization can comprise the number of source components, their initialization, and the constraints they need to obey, or all of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Blend](blend.ipynb#scarlet.blend.Blend) class contains all of the information about the scene, i.e. the collection of Sources, as well as routines for fitting the joint model to data.\n",
    "It implements the minimization algorithm described in [Moolekamp & Melchior 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09066).\n",
    "Below is a very brief summary of the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The deblending algorithm forms a model of the scene\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{M}= \\sum_{k=1}^K \\mathsf{A}_k^T \\times \\mathsf{S}_k = \\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{A}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^B$ is the normalized SED and $\\mathsf{S}_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is the morphology of a single component in the model with $B$ bands and $N$ pixels in each band.\n",
    "It is important to note that this matrix factorization implies that SEDs and morphologies are independent, e.g. the SED of a component does not change over the region covered by its morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scene is fit by minimizing the likelihood of the model, namely minimizing\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{S}) = \\frac{1}{2} || \\mathsf{Y}-\\mathsf{A}\\mathsf{S} ||_2^2, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathsf{Y}$ is an image cube and $||.||_2$ is the element-wise $L_2$ (Frobenius) norm.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Those constraints are applied to each source in the form of proximal operators, a handy mathematical approach for imposing non-smooth constraints that (if properly formulated) are guaranteed to converge; the curious reader will find more details in [Parikh & Boyd 2014](http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/prox_algs.pdf) and [Combettes & Pesquet 2011](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-9569-8_10).\n",
    "In short, proximal operators map an input vector to the nearest vector that satisfied the respective constraint.\n",
    "Many constraints/penalty functions have analytic proximal operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "*scarlet* allows for two different kinds of constraints: proximal operators in the direct domain (that is directly on the SEDs $\\mathsf{A}_k$ and morphologies $\\mathsf{S}_k$) or in the transformed domain, i.e. after SEDs and morphologies are transformed by a linear operator $\\mathsf{L}$ that is specified by the user. Any linear operator is allowed (it does not have to be invertible), examples are finite differences or basis transforms. The main reason for working in the transformed domain is that it can be much easier to express the constraint, for instance that a particular solution have only one Fourier coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proximal operators for the direct and transformed domain behave differently. The former can be thought of as *strictly* obeyed at every iteration, while the latter ones will converge to a solution that obeys the constraint eventually. \n",
    "To see this it is useful to understand how $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{S}$ are updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow \\textrm{prox}_{\\lambda f} \\left( x^{\\textrm{it}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho} \\mathsf{L}^T \\left( \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}}-z^{\\textrm{it}} + u^{\\textrm{it}} \\right) \\right)$$\n",

    "$$z^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow \\textrm{prox}_{\\rho g} \\left( \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}+1} + u^{\\textrm{it}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u^{\\textrm{it}+1} \\leftarrow u^{\\textrm{it}} + \\mathsf{L} x^{\\textrm{it}+1} - z^{\\textrm{it}+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x^{\\textrm{it}}$ denotes either $\\mathsf{A}_k$ or $\\mathsf{S}_k$ in the current iteration, and $\\textrm{prox}_f$ performs (at least) a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the log-likelihood. $\\textrm{prox}_g$ is the proximal operator in the transformed domain as it acts on $\\mathsf{L} x$ instead of $x$.\n",
    "If additional constraints in the direct domain are present, they will be subsumed in $\\textrm{prox}_f$, thus making sure that they are satisfied in every iteration."
