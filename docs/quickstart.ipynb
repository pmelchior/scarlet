At the least, a `Frame` holds the `shape` of the cube, for which we use the convention `(C, Ny, Nx)` for the number of elements in 3 dimensions: `C` for the number of bands/channels and `Ny, Nx` for the number of pixels at every channel.\n",

The reason for specifying them is to enable the code to internally map from the model frame, in which you seek to fit a model, to the observed data frame.\n",
