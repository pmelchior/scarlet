    '''Matches datasets at different resolutions

    Finds the region of overlap between two datasets and creates a mask for the region as well as the pixel coordinates
    for the dataset pixels inside the overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape_hr, shape_lr: tuples
        shapes of the two datasets
    wcs_hr, wcs_lr: WCS objects
        WCS of the Low and High resolution fields respectively
    perimeter: string
        returns the coordinates in the intersection or union of both frames if set to 'overlap' or 'union' respectively

    Returns
    -------
    coordlr_over_lr: array
        coordinates of the matching pixels at low resolution in the low resolution frame.
    coordlr_over_hr: array
        coordinates of the matching pixels at low resolution in the high resolution frame.
    coordhr_hr: array
        coordinates of the high resolution pixels in the overlap. Necessary for psf matching
