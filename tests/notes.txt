operator.py
- Eliminated the unused (and broken) `strict_monotonicity` from `operator`
- Skipped tests for `prox_cone`, since it is not implemented and I am not 100% sure how it works
- Skipped tests for `project_disk_sed_mean` since it is deprecated and does not work as expected
- Skipped `proximal_disk_sed` since it is unused and possibly broken
constraint.py
- Skipped `DirectMonotonicityConstraint` with `exact=True` since it is broken
- Skipped broken TVx and TVy constraints, since they are not used. Fixing these could also include
  the addition of a TV prox_f operator.
- ConstraintAdapter tests to be handled by Component
- getRadialMonotonicOp, getRadialMonotonicWeights, and the utility
  functions to build those are all used in the proximal operators, so
  those functions are already tested and are not further tested.
